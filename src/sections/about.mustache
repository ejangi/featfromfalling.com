        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>After a decade in hiatus, Tim Brouwer, James Angus and Tim Burstow are back with a new band, a new sound and a new way of thinking about their music.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>&#x201C;We have been feeling for a while that there was a bit of a shortage of songs that fall into the category of the lament. We were thirsty for songs that tell it like it is, not just what we want it to be. Sometimes life is gut-wrenching, like watching loved ones pass away, losing faith, trying to find hope in the midst of depression and desperately trying to stave off temptation. We felt that there wasn&#x2019;t really much out there for us when we were in those places. We know God is with us, we feel it when we&#x2019;re in a good place, but we also know he&#x2019;s with us in the hard stuff, even if it may not feel like it. That&#x2019;s the place we wanted to write music into.&#x201D; says James.</p>

        <p>In August 2018, the band released their self-produced debut, It&#x2019;s Okay to Look Down.</p>
